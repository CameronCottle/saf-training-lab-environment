# saf-training-lab-environment

The InSpec Assessor Lab is a GitHub environment that makes it quick and easy for you to start learning and working on executing your own InSpec profiles.

It is also a great, quick, and easy way to test and demonstrate what you have learned or collaborate with others to get help with what you are working on.

## Overview of the Lab
